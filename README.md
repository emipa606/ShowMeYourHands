# ShowMeYourHands

Pawns show their hands on their weapon when drafted. 
Should work with most weapons, vanilla and modded.

Based on https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2171708109]Clutter Weapon Hands but dynamically sets the hands based on the graphics of the weapon. It will however still use the old hand-definitions if they exist.

There is also mod-settings where you can modify the settings for each weapon. These settings can be exported and included in a mod to add native support.
All my "Continued"-mods should have native support.

There is also support for https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2543371889]Enable Oversized Weapons, https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2038409475]Yayo's Combat 3, https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2513695736]Yayo's Combat 3 [Adopted], https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2575938407]Yayo's Animation, https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1204108550]RunAndGun and https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1628211313]Dual Wield. Hands will follow the weapons even during the extra animations. 
Verified to work with https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1631756268]Combat Extended

Since modding is just a hobby for me I expect no donations to keep modding. If you still want to show your support you can gift me anything from my https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/Mlie]Wishlist or buy me a cup of tea.
