Pawns show their hands on their weapon when drafted. 
Should work with most weapons, vanilla and modded.

Based on [Clutter Weapon Hands](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2171708109) but dynamically sets the hands based on the graphics of the weapon. It will however still use the old hand-definitions if they exist.

There is also mod-settings where you can modify the settings for each weapon. These settings can be exported and included in a mod to add native support.
All my "Continued"-mods should have native support.

There is also support for [Enable Oversized Weapons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2543371889), [Yayo's Combat 3](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2038409475), [Yayo's Combat 3 [Adopted]](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2513695736), [Yayo's Animation](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2575938407), [RunAndGun](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1204108550) and [Dual Wield](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1628211313). Hands will follow the weapons even during the extra animations. 
Verified to work with [Combat Extended](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1631756268)
